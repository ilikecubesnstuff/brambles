Hi!

My name is Subhadeep Sarkar.
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Barcelona, studying the dynamics of the Milky Way disk.
However, this blog is (largely) not about my research (see my [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0009-0006-9454-5141) for that).

I often find myself exploring random things that interest me, whether they are aligned with my current research or hobbies or not.
Rather than letting these explorations decompose in my file system, I could consolidate them here.
This blog aims to be a collection of such ramblings.
Hell, if I want to write something for fun, I could do that here, too.

Thank you, internet person, for happening upon my blog.
I hope you find something fruitful, here or elsewhere.
