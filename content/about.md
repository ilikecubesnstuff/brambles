title: About
deck: May the wary but courageous wanderer, through the brambled bed of the forest of knowledge, find and savour the sweetest berries.

This blog spawned out of my friend, author of [Thoughts From A Lake](https://lekhbhatia.github.io/), pushing me create something similar. Historically, I have had many random, tangential explorations I would often discuss with friends, but never really documented them. This blog is an attempt to consolidate those ramblings.

I enjoy puzzles and abstractions, so my posts will often operate in that space.

On a more technical note, the website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (for static site generation) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (for rendering computational markdown documents).
I am using [LaTeX.css](https://latex.vercel.app/) to give the appearance of a LaTeX document, and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for rendering math. I also created this logo using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)!
